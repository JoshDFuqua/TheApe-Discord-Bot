# TheApe Discord Bot
The Ape is a bot I have created for a private Discord server that I frequent.  Feel free to submit any PR's, and I'll check them out.

# Collaboration Standards
## Branches
When cutting a new branch, please name the branch the name of the feature you wish to work on
## Commits
When making commits, please name the commit by the directory of the main file you're working on, followed by the file name.  For example, if I am working on the file `commands/resources/dictionary.js`, I would name the file `Resources Dictionary`.
In the event you are doing some general work, like refactoring, adding dependencies, etc, you can use a name like `Systems Update`.
I am open to discussing naming convention changing, if anyone has ideas they would like to share.
